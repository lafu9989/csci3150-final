                            <p>Perhaps the most salient argument for Universal Design is the argument for good design in general. Everything we interact with in the world has a design. And due to the nature of that design, certain functions are made available. A design essentially defines what a tool can or cannot be used for, and thus can be used as a form of exclusion or inclusion. A good design avoid user frustration and allows users to easily use the device in the way they intended. It feels seamless and promotes inclusion rather than exclusion.</p>
                            <p style="margin-bottom: 0px;">The Centre for Excellence in Universal Design in Ireland lists the following seven principles of Universal Design:</p>
                            <blockquote>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Equitable Use</li>
                                    <li>Flexibility in Use</li>
                                    <li>Simple and Intuitive Use</li>
                                    <li>Perceptible Information</li>
                                    <li>Tolerance for Error</li>
                                    <li>Low Physical Effort</li>
                                    <li>Size and Space for Approach and Use</li>
                                </ol>
                                <footer>- Centre for Excellence in Universal Design, "<a href="https://universaldesign.ie/about-universal-design/the-7-principles" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The 7 Principles</a>" (2023)</footer>

                            <p>We can see from these principles that Universal Design promotes good design by its very nature. It promotes products and designs that are "easy to use" -- designs where you barely need to think to figure out how to use something.</p>
                            <p>Of course, there are many arguments for Universal Design on the Web. The world's population is diverse, and more people are accessing the Web than ever before. The <abbr title="Centers for Disease Control and Prevention">CDC</abbr> in the United States estimates that nearly 28% of all Americans have some type of disability, and an aging population means that more elderly people, who are more likely to be disabled in some way, will be accessing the Web. In addition, with the modern ubiquity of devices, users will be accessing the Web from all sorts of environments, all the time. Universal Design is more important now than ever before and will only continue to become more important as the Web becomes a central part of our lives.</p>
